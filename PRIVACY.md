# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 25, 2026**

TalkToFigma Desktop ("the Application") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.

### Data Collection

The Application collects **minimal, anonymous usage data** to improve the product:

- **Anonymous Analytics**: We use [Aptabase](https://aptabase.com), a privacy-friendly analytics service, to collect:
  - Application launch events
  - Feature usage statistics (which features are used, not what you create)
  - Error and crash reports (anonymized stack traces)
  - General device information (OS version, app version)

**What we DO NOT collect:**
- ❌ Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- ❌ Figma file contents or designs
- ❌ Your Figma account credentials
- ❌ IP addresses or precise location data
- ❌ Any data from your Body and Surroundings
- ❌ Browsing history or behavior outside the app

### Local Data Storage

The Application stores the following data **locally on your device only**:
- Figma OAuth tokens (encrypted in system keychain)
- Application preferences and settings
- Log files for debugging

**This data never leaves your device.**

### Third-Party Services

- **Figma API**: When you authenticate with Figma, the Application communicates directly with Figma's servers using OAuth 2.0. We do not intercept or store your Figma data.
- **Aptabase**: Anonymous usage analytics as described above. Aptabase is GDPR-compliant and does not track individuals.

### Data Sharing

We **do not sell, rent, or share** your data with third parties. The anonymous analytics data collected via Aptabase is used solely to improve the Application.

### Your Rights

You can:
- Opt out of analytics by disabling them in Application settings (if implemented)
- Delete all local data by uninstalling the Application
- Request information about data collection by contacting us
